## Known Bugs
The Heroku free dyno type subscription comes with one giant limitation. The app will go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. When the app is asleep, the next user to access any of its resources will have to wait while the app spins up, resulting in a suboptimal user experience. The screen could be blank for up to 30 seconds before the app loads. ‚è∞
