# Finders Teepers

An application solely for practice using a tech stack of React, Material-UI & Apollo on the frontend with Prisma & GraphQL Yoga on the backend while deployed to Heroku.

## Known Bugs
Heroku comes with one giant limitation. The app will go to sleep after an hour of inactivity.
When the app is asleep, the next user to access any of its resources will have to wait while the app spins up, resulting in a suboptimal user experience. The screen will be blank for about 30 seconds before the app loads. ‚è∞
